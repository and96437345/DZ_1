    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <div class="html-tutorial"><b>HyperText Markup Language <u>(HTML)</u></b> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br><br>  
Web browsers receive <u>HTML</u> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <u>HTML</u> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.<br><br>
<u>HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of <u>HTML</u> pages. With <u>HTML</u> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <u>HTML</u> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. <u>HTML</u> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <span>&lt;img /&gt;</span> and <span>&lt;input /&gt;</span> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <span>&lt;p&gt;</span> and <span>&lt;/p&gt;</span> surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the <u>HTML</u> tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</div>

    <h2>Markup</h2>
    <div class="html-tutorial"><u>HTML</u> markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. <u>HTML</u> tags most commonly come in pairs like <span>&lt;h1&gt;</span> and <span>&lt;/h1&gt;</span>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <span>&lt;img&gt;</span>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).<br><br>

        Another important component is the <u>HTML</u> document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.<br><br>
        
        The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</div>
    <div class="program">
      <pre>
          &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
          &lt;html&gt;
                  &lt;head&gt;
                          &lt;title&gt;<span>This is a title</span>&lt;/title&gt;
                  &lt;/head&gt;
                  &lt;body&gt;
                          &lt;p&gt;<span>Hello world!</span>&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/body&gt;
          &lt;/html&gt;
      </pre>
